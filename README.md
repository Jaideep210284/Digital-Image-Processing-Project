Blood Cell Detection and Classification
An integral part of contemporary healthcare diagnostics is blood cell analysis, which offers vital information about a patient's haematological health. This project focuses on leveraging advanced technology and algorithms to provide quick and precise evaluation of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets using the BCCD dataset. The main goals of this study are to create and evaluate three distinct blood cell detection models: YOLO V5, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

Overview
This project aims to compare a deep learning model with conventional machine learning techniques and assess each model's accuracy and resilience in blood cell detection and classification. The efficiency of blood cell identification has increased with the introduction of sophisticated image processing and machine learning techniques, which are crucial to medical diagnostics.

Objectives
To develop and evaluate three distinct blood cell detection models: YOLO V5, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
To compare the performance of a deep learning model with conventional machine learning techniques.
To assess each model's accuracy and resilience in blood cell classification.
Methods
U-Net: Used for the segmentation of blood cells.
YOLO V5: Utilized for the classification of RBCs and WBCs, providing a detailed understanding of cell morphology.
